#### Analysis

-The codding of the project went according to plan. Software Engineers and Software Architect did an amazing job and completed all the coding for the Core and completion of the project before due dates. On the other hand testing of the didn't go as planned. 

-The tester did not test the core code before the deadline even though the code was done ahead of schedule. This happened because software engineer forgot to update tester about the status of project and send the code. The tester also didn't remember to check in with team, to send the code for testing. The project also didn't checked in the project status.
As a result, this highlights the lack of communication among team members regarding project status and what stage is everyone working on. There is not  proper communication between the team members beacuasue of the fact that tester and project manager are distance students.
